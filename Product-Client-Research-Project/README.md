# Product and Client Research Project

## Background
* A pharma entity conducted some research on their main products and clients during a certain period. Around 16,000 of their clients were selected during the research period.
The pharma industry is currently heavily focused on the Leishmaniasis disease and ensuring drugs get to market via their customers in an effective and efficient manner.


## Objective
* Create customersâ€™ profile to make the pharma entity aware of its typical customer selling their products in markets successfully.
Develop models that will allow the company to use the results to target new and similar customers in future.

## Models
* 1st model: estimate the probability of customers who responded to the research
Implement a logistic regression model to classify if a customer purchased drugs during the research period.
* 2nd model: estimate the size ($) of the transaction
Implement decision tree, random forest, and Xgboost models to estimate the purchase amount ($) for each customer.
